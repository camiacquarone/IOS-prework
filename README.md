## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Duolingo App 
- Keeps track of a streak (how many days you completed your lesson goals)
- Fill in the blank activity where you can drag and drop words and phrases 

Pinterest App
- The layout that allows you to see multiple inspirations at once 
- Allowing you to save pins into categories, which facilitates the process to revisting the pins later 

Spotify 
- Recommends songs based on previous engangement 
- When you add a song to queue, you can drag it into the order that you want 

An app I would like to build is "FitBuddies". FitBuddies would be an app that allows you to track and motivate children to participate in physical activity. Once you log in activity, you are able to play fun interactives games, personalize your characters, and move along levels and journeys. The goal of this app is to inspire children to move in their own way and be able to see growth. 

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
